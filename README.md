# Foodie Sher

A Restaurant Table Booking Flutter Application


# App Overview

The flutter app is backed by Firebase & Google Maps Platform for most of its services. It uses Google Maps Platform for the map view and showing your closest restaurants on them. It uses firebase backed, Google Sign-in and Phone Number Login both. You can use either of them. The app requires the User's location permission for knowing which restaurants are around you and mark them on the map. The app shows very minimal content to make it look cleaner. The app is dark themed so users can experience its rich UI even better. In the end, the app is connected to Razor Pay powered payment gateway which lets you use UPI or any Card or Internet Bank to make the transaction.

Note: The payment gateway is in testing mode so you won't be charged any money even if you try to make the payment.

## Running the app

To run the project, you require an android environment. It's not configured for iOS by now. You just need to put your Google Maps Platform Key into the app's Android manifest file and foodie_bunny widget file.
